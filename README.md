# ARAudioVisualizer
Very early version of a AR Music Visualizer concept. Instruments animate as they begin playing.
 
___How to Use:___

1) Tap screen to playback sample audio. The cursor will start moving and instruments will animate as they are played.
2) Tap screen again to pause audio and animations.
3) Press and hold the screen to stop and reset playback.

___Future Iterations:___

The intention of this project is to lay the groundwork for a reusable app that serves as a template for adding AR visuals to audio. More complex, interesting, & visually appealing 3D models + animations will ultimately be implemented, with options to import your own audio and 3D model. Users will also be able to set up their scene by selecting your own animations and model placements.
